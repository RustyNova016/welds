# Integration Tests for Welds

This is a collection of tests that run on real database.

For simplicity of testing. The database they run against are wrapped in docker.
You as a developer using these test don't have to worry about docker or booting these DBs, 
but a running version of docker that you have access to is required to run these tests

## Running tests

From this directory
```
cargo test
