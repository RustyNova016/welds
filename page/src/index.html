			<h3>What is Welds</h3>
		<p>
			Welds is an ORM written in Rust, designed to simplify and streamline the process of database interaction. 
			This ORM is built to be fully asynchronous, 
			allowing for efficient and non-blocking communication with the database. 
			Supporting a range of popular databases including 
			<b>Mssql</b>, <b>MySql</b>, <b>Postgres</b>, and <b>Sqlite</b>, 
			this ORM offers a flexible and customizable approach to data management. Developed with ease of use in mind, this ORM offers a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy to integrate with any Rust application. Whether you're working on a small project or a large-scale application, this ORM provides a powerful and reliable solution for managing your data.
		</p>

			<h3>Only When Needed</h3>
		<p>
		This ORM is built on top of the SQLx library, a Rust library for async access to databases. By leveraging the features of SQLx, this ORM provides an even more streamlined interface for developers, while still allowing for the flexibility to drop down to a lower level if more fine-grained control is needed. This means that developers can take advantage of the high-level abstractions and ease of use provided by the ORM, but can also drop down to raw SQL queries if they need to perform more complex operations. The result is a powerful and flexible tool that strikes a balance between simplicity and control, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of database-driven applications.
